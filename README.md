Budget

This Budget website is created only using HTML, CSS & SCSS and Vanilla JavaScript.

For the moment, this web only looks kinda okay in mobile view. I'm still suck at front-end programming. This is my second attempt on building everything from the scratch, from HTML to CSS which I'm not very good at. You can see it live here at myFiddle Codepen - https://jsfiddle.net/lalapolalaanewb/hx0sL5cf/ . Feel free to try it out.

Migrating from PHP-based to fully JavaScript-based is very challenging for me at least. Anyway, I'll update more details for this Budget Web App in near future. Learning through making. Hopefully my code will help you guys somehow. Or will actually help me getting more better at JavaScript programming with your comments and feedback.

Thank you for spending time reading and trying my Web App. Till next time. Chao!
